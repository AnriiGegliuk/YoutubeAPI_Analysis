0,JyGNg8a6V6E,Jonna Jinton,A Tour in my New house,"I'm so happy to finally share with you about this project I've been working on lately. It's a dream coming true and something I'm sure will bring a lot of new energy and inspiration into my future videos and creative projects.

It's still a lot of work until I can move in, but the thought of me working from my new art studio in the late spring/early summer makes my heart tingle of happiness. I'm so grateful that I get to make this dream come true. I look forward to make a lot of beautiful things in my new creative space that I will get to share with all of you. 

Thank you for being part of this journey and for your love and support! 
I'm sending you an abundance of hugs and positive vibes, where ever you are in this world ♥

In the beginning of winter the ice isn't too thick yet so it is very easy to use the ice saw to make a hole. Later in the winter the ice can be 1 meter thick and it then takes a lot of time and effort to create the ice holes.

I recorded this video last week and it contains a little bit of everything. Everyday life and work and beautiful winter days. I also started the project of recording sounds every night in the ""creepy forest"", which is the forest just behind our homestead, and which has been a mystic place ever since we moved here. 

I also talk a bit about the BEAUTIFUL response I/we got on the previous video with all the messaged from people all around the world. From the bottom of my heart, thank you everyone! ♥

6,HsKWoCJ3eq4,Jonna Jinton,A Message that will Change Your Life,"If I could only leave one video behind me after my time on this earth, I would choose this one. Because I believe that every human on this earth can at least find one message in this video that goes right through their barriers and reaches the soul. 
This video contains everything that I've ever wished to share and give through my videos/music/art.
It opens our hearts and give us space to heal. Because it makes us understand that we are not alone in this world. We are not as different from each other that we might think.

Together we have the power to create a more loving, peaceful world through compassion and understanding. And watching this video at least make me feel like a wave of hope and light.

I've cried rivers while editing this video. Just working on this video has been like a healing journey for me. I feel so deeply grateful in a way that I could never express in words.
From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU everyone who contributed to creating this video. It's been an impossible mission to go through every single video, and I wish I could fit all of your videos in here. But please know, that I am so grateful for every single message. And I will continue to share your videos in the end of my future vlogs. So even if your video could not fit into this video, it might be shared later on :)

To all of you who are here watching this video, THANK YOU! I hope it can bring you inspiration, hope, strength and positive energy for this new year ahead of us ♥

9,_ZcEUXtcMCw,Jonna Jinton,A Salutation to Light in the Darkest of Nights,"In December we are in the midst of the darkest time of the year here in Sweden. The sun barely reaches above the treetops and the evenings feels never ending. Ever since I was a child I have loved the Lucia day on Dec 13,  where we celebrate the light in the darkness, with candles and singing.

And since many years back, I have done my own little twist on this lucia celebration, and lighted candles in the forest.
It is truly one of the traditions I love the most, and the message of bringing light into the darkness can be so healing on many levels. 

""There is no darkness so dense, so menacing, or so difficult that it cannot be overcome by light.""
- Vern P Stanfill

I wish all of you a good ending of this year. Thank you for being here on this channel and for watching my videos, and commenting from your heart. I'm so grateful to you all ♥

10,XO--chkQ_9w,Jonna Jinton,Be like the Bison | Walk through the storms,"This video is about the meaning behind the words ""Be like the Bison"" and why it means so much to me, and why I chose to create jewelry with these words engraved. 
I first shared about these words in an earlier video that I made almost 2 years ago, I have linked it down below if you would like to watch it.
► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7ev29b9sqM

After I shared that video a lot of people found strength in those words just as I did. And then I got the idea to make myself a necklace with those words engraved, since they had helped me so much. And that's how the idea for these designs came, which I created together with my mother Anita and my husband Johan. 

This specific video was first made for my webshop, since I wanted to have an explanation to these bison jewelry designs on the product page. But then I thought I wanted to publish it as a video on YouTube as well, since I think these motivational words deserve an own video.
I know there is plenty of people out there who also can find a lot of strength in these words. 
And you don't need any jewelry at all to get the power from these words. Carrying them in your heart is way more powerful. The jewelry is just a bonus and something I wanted to create just to have as a beautiful accessory with a reminder of this message. 
Our mindset can really change everything in our lives. It's beautiful how just a few words can be really transformative for how we confront life, if you choose to charge them with that power you have within you ♥

Thank you so much for watching this video. I hope the video can be a reminder that you are stronger than you think, and that you will get through any storm that comes your way ♥

And I will forever be grateful to Jesper Westmark ( @jesperwestmark on Instagram) for sharing these words with me on the meditation retreat April 2021.

11,T794jU-UXZU,Jonna Jinton,A journey into the Wild | The story behind the Antler jewelry,"In this video I will share the story and creative process of the Wild jewelry collection, and what inspired us to create these antler pieces.
► My Art & Jewelry Webshop: https://jonnajintonsweden.com

A beautiful reindeer antler found in the forest when my parents walked their dog, became the inspiration to these pieces of jewelry. It was almost a year long process before we got to the real result, and held the silver antler jewelry in our hands. We are so happy with how they turned out in the end. 
I hope this little story can bring you some inspiration.  Or just to get a little glimpse in how it can look like behind the scenes of creating jewelry, from idea to finished result.

Thank you SO much for watching ♥

We have some busy days ahead of us with a lot of work with the last preparations. And we are really excited and also very relieved to finally get to this point after a year of work ”behind the scenes”.

The new designs will be available on our webshop this Friday 11th of November 🔥❤️

14,UpmeswMK7cY,Jonna Jinton,The Spirit Song -  A Nordic Lullaby,"If the spirit of the mist could sing us a lullaby, how would it sound like?
I created this song with an intention to give you a little glimpse into that mystical realm of the mist, which I feel is like a bridge between our world and other dimensions. The mist has always been an inspiration in my work and art. It's just something there that excites me so deeply. 
When the mist is dancing over the forest lakes in the bright nights, I feel like I get to see and experience something that is almost not real in our physical world. It's almost pulling me into something else. Like it's calling on us, to be still and listen, and to connect to something deeper within us.
All the mist that you see in this video, is 100% real and filmed in the beautiful nature where I live.

I also wanted to give this song a touch of the ancient nordic folktunes, which has this incredible way of sounding sad and hopeful at the same time. In Swedish you call it ""vemod"". The closest I can describe it is as a melancholy feeling. And I have always felt very drawned to that. I like when the line between feelings is erased, so that you can feel it all at the same time. The sorrow, the joy, the light and the dark, the heaviness of being a human, the beauty of being alive. The physical world and the spirit world. 

I feel like I could go on forever and talk about this. But enough talking for now! :) 
I really hope you will enjoy the song and the music video. 
It's in Swedish, but I will write the lyrics to it down below. 

LOTS of love to you all! ♥

► Lyrics in Swedish + English translation (Text and music: Jonna Jinton)

Så lilla vän 
(Sweet friend)
Dimman för dig hem igen
(The mist will carry you home again)
Om du går vilse 
(If you get lost)

Natten är lång
(The night is long)
Tusen stjärnors urtidssång
(The ancient song of a thousand stars)
Dimmorna dansar
(The mist is dancing)

Sov lilla vän
(Sleep little friend)
Skogen vaktar, värmer dig
(The forest guards you, and keep you warm)
Om du är frusen
(If you are cold)

Norrskensljus
(Northern lights)
Dansar över skog och fjäll
(Dancing over the forest and mountains)
Brinner i natten
(Burning in the night)

Så lilla vän 
(Sweet friend)
Dimman för dig hem igen

Om du går vilse

Every day I feel so grateful for living on this beautiful place on earth. For being born in a country that allow me to be free and make my own choices in life. A country with fresh air and clean water. With free education and free medical care. A country where I’ve grown up without the fear of war or the sound of falling boms. A country that has given me the space and freedom to do what I want and be who I want to be.
I never want to take all this for granted. I feel so lucky to be born in a country like this.
Thank you Sweden, for everything you given me 🇸🇪❤️🙏🏻

But this April was so much more easy than it used to be, and that's because I actually traveled away to the south for a while :) It was not to a very warm country, but it was definitely much more spring and warmth than it was here. And that was so helpful! 

Now the best time is ahead of us and i feel so much more recharged now.

As you see we still have a lot of snow (and it's been snowing for two days here now again) so the winter is still holding on tight, but another month left and we should be in a totally different energy with spring blooming all around us. Never been longing so much for spring in my entire life (I say that every year I know). 

Hope you will enjoy the video! Sending you so much love and big hugs! ♥

Thank you for waiting so patiently for my videos.

As usual, this video contains a mix of everything that's been going on in February. It's been a hard winter. Very cold and a lot of snow. But beautiful and magical, as always.
We are now seeing the first signs of the spring, and even if I love the winter, I start to feel very ready for spring.

26,8dvR_9_jsv4,Jonna Jinton,Song of the ice | 10 HOURS raw ice sounds for sleep/meditation/relax,"Every winter as the ice begin to grow on the lake it creates magical sounds that been fascinating me for as long as I can remember.  These sounds can be heard really loud, especially in the nights as the temperature drops very quickly. Since 4 years back I've been recording these sounds, so each year I make a new video with the sounds of the ice. These sounds are all recorded this winter of 2021-2022. Listen with headphones for the best experience, since some of the sounds are too deep to be heard on a mobile device or on a computer. 
All the footage of the ice is recorded by the same lake that creates the sounds :)

Many people experience a calming feeling when listening to these sounds. It reminds us of the sounds of whale singing. And it also reminds us of the sound from before we were born, when we were inside the womb.
I personally love to have the ice sound in the background while writing, painting or meditate. 

Let me know what you think of these sounds! I hope you will enjoy it!
Thank you so much for watching/listening to this video! ♥

It's been such a crazy beautiful time this last month, and it's been a lot of good things happening, which I want to share with you in this video. But he past 2 weeks have been extremely cold so in the middle of the editing of this video I had to stop working and just take care of my house and keep the fires alive. That's why it took so long time for me to upload this video. 
But now its finally done and IM SO HAPPY to connect with you all again! 

I had so much more I wanted to share in this video but that I didn't have time to edit. For example a scene when me and Johan talks about how grateful we felt for all the loving comments that we got on the previous video. So I say it now instead from both of us, THANK YOU!!! ♥

I hope you will enjoy this long video from the daily life in the North of Sweden!

34,YkZvUZc8whs,Jonna Jinton,The making of Silvr Fjall - Original Artwork,"- This video contains my own products and creations -
This is a short little video about my latest painting called ""Silvr Fjall"", which means ""Silver Mountains"" in Old Norse. I made it in the winter (2020-2021) and it's been hanging in my art studio for a while. 
This painting is now up for auction on my website between Thursday Sep 2 - Sunday Sep 5. 
► https://auctions.jonnajintonsweden.com/

Silvr Fjall is made out of acrylic paint and my own handmade earth paints. In this painting I've used mostly charcoal and ashes and mixed it with the blue. These really dark parts (blackish) is basically only charcoal paint that I made from the charcoal from our fire stove. 

I look forward to spend more time in my art studio again and create more paintings this winter. The winter is definitely the time when I get so much inspiration to paint. 

I hope you enjoyed this little video! Stay tuned for another vlog soon!
Much love to you all! ♥

Didn't have so much to say but sometimes that is not needed. I thought you might enjoy hanging around with me and Nanook in our daily life. Working in my studio, being out in nature, tapping birch sap, visiting my grand-uncle Tage and just enjoying the very first days of spring. 

May is one of the most amazing times of the year I think. Everything just feel so new and as the snow melts away each day the spring blooms out and makes the air smell like sweet birch leafs. I love this time so, soooo much! 

Thank you so much for watching!! I hope you liked the video!

This winter has been extra hard. Crazy amounts of snow and extreme cold weather for over 3 weeks. It takes a lot of energy to keep up the normal life. But it also gives a lot of energy with all the beauty that the winter brings. It's a love-hate relationship. 

In this video I share glimpses of what I've been up to for the past month. Both the struggles, but also all the beautiful moments. I also share some behind the scenes of my previous video, when I went on a road trip to the very North of Sweden to record some footage. 

I really hope you will enjoy the video! And thank you for all your comments!!

44,hXeLTqKs4gA,Jonna Jinton,Mystical sounds of the ice 2020 | RAW ICE SOUNDS - 3 hours for meditation/sleep/study,"As the ice begins to settle in the winter it creates mystical and otherworldly sounds that I've been fascinated by for many years. This is the third year in a row that I record the singing ice from the lake where I live. Every year creates unique ice sounds depending the weather, temperature and how the ice grows. This 3 hour long ice sound video is made completely by raw ice sounds that were recorded in the end of November 2020. 
Listen with headphones for best sound experience. 
All the footage of the ice is recorded by the same lake that creates the sounds :)

► If you want to know more about why the ice makes these sounds, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chxn2szgEAg&feature=youtu.be

► Listen to the ice sounds from the previous year (every year creates unique sounds): 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-CwJa1SHE

► Fine art prints of the ice that I've taken this last year:
https://jonnajintonsweden.com/product-category/photoprints/rectangular-vertical/ice/

Many people experience a calming feeling when listening to these sounds. It reminds us of the sounds of whale singing. And it also reminds us of the sound from before we were born, when we were inside the womb.
I personally love to have the ice sound in the background while writing, painting or meditate. 

Let me know what you think of these sounds! I hope you will enjoy it!

November has been another month with a lot of work mixed with some peaceful moments in nature. Winter came, and left, and came back again. Many evenings has been spent in the studio painting ice and snow. The night by the fire filled my heart with warmth. Nanook loves playing hide and seek.
And another friend of ours started working in our little business. These are a few glimpses of my November so far that you will see more of in this video.

For real, these days was the best in the whole summer so far, and I am sure you will understand why after watching this video.
It was my little mini vacation of 4 days but I felt as if I filled my heart with memories that I will have for the rest of my live. Yeah...this place in the mountains really has a special place in my heart.

So in this video I will share with you my days in the cabin and exploring the beautiful nature of Marsjällen, in the north of Sweden. 

And by the way, I am so thankful for all the beautiful comments on my previous video where I shared about the sleeping paralysis. I can't believe so many would understand and have gone trough similar experiences. Just wanted you to know that it means a lot to me! 

Hope you will enjoy the video!

Just to mention some of the things that you will see in this video. As always, going to the mountains is my absolute favorite thing to do, and this time I went further north than usual. But I had to change my plans pretty quick because of the weather conditions, but instead it lead to something even better. 

This is the first episode of this roadtrip. The next one will come soon.
I hope you will enjoy this video! And I hope you all have a beautiful summer!

Yes, this month really has it all. In this video I will bring you into some days from this beautiful month plus some funny behind the scenes facts about my previous Q&A video, that costed me 3 days of sickness and a new phone. 
I will also share some happy scenes from my midsummer celebration. And lots of more! 

The summers really has a special energy. A lot of things are constantly happening and moving around you. It's a wonderful time, but I often find it hard to feel the peace and calm within, and focus on one thing at a time. You attention is split up in a thousand different directions. 
But that is the energy of the bursting summer, and I try to go with the flow instead to fighting it. 
So thats a reason to why I didn't get this video published in June as my plan was from the beginning. 
But I hope you will enjoy it now instead! :)

54,h4IzhzFPLhs,Jonna Jinton,NORDIC HERDINGCALL  - Welcoming spring with kulning,"In Sweden we call it ""Vårskrik"", which is a way to shout out your happiness when spring arrives. And this is my way of welcoming this new beautiful time of the year. 
I recorded this video only 3 days ago. It was such a beautiful evening and the air was so fresh and the swans were flying above me and all the birds were singing loudly. 
This time is truly magical.

I went to some different places in nature and did some kulning (ancient nordic herdingcall) and then mixed it into this video/song. If you listen carefully you will here that every place have different acoustic. The forest and the lake was my favorite. 

After the coldest May in my entire life, the spring is now officially here! 
And I am so deeply happy for that.

I really hope you liked this little song!

55,JUBLHwBDBeU,Jonna Jinton,How I make paint of earth pigments | Painting tutorial,"Hi my loves!
A very common question that I've got lately is about my painting technique and how I make paint out of natural materials like stones, sand, ashes, charcoal, mud etc. 
So in this video I wanted to open up the door into my little painting world and show you step by step how I make my own paint with these natural materials. 

Painting is one of my biggest passions in life, and since I started making my very own paints from pigments in nature I really felt how something ""clicked"" and I really found something that felt completely right in my heart. The first week I started experimenting with making my own paint I just couldn't stop paint. I locked myself into the studio and felt spellbound by these beautiful colors and textures from nature. 
And I keep learning and exploring every time I paint, and keep experimenting with different materials from nature.

I really hope I could give you all some inspiration and some answers to all your questions about my painting technique! :)

58,WPfXSr3Vy00,Jonna Jinton,The circle of life | Ep. 39,"Hi my lovely friends!
So much have happened since my last video. Both in our lives, but also in the world. Isn't it strange how fast things can change? How vulnerable we actually are. 
It's a time with so much thoughts in my mind, and I guess, also in yours. But I hope with this video I can share some inspiration and positive vibes from our daily lives in the northern woods. 

It's still the time of the year when I struggle with creativity, but it's only about a month left until the spring arrives here as well. And I think the spring will come with so much new energy. And I hope to use it in making more videos and music, and hopefully be able to spread some good energy in this hard times. 

So in this video you will see what I've been up to lately. We have finally moved our jewelry smithy into our new renovated room in the barn. And we needed to change some plans and make new decisions regarding the release of the new webshop that was suppose to happen now in April, because of the situation in the world right now.  We have also gone trough a loss here in our little family. We lost one of our cats, which has been making us feel very down lately. 
I will let you know more about all this in the video. 

I hope you will like the video! Thank you so much for watching! ♥
And my heart goes out to all of you in the world who has a challenging time right now. 
Stay safe and well. 
Much love to all of you ♥

This song from the movie has always been very dear to me, especially as I was a child. But still now, as an adult, I feel so much for this song. 
For a long time now I wanted to make my own version of it, and make some small changes in the melody. What do you think? :) 

I really hope you will enjoy my version of this song! 
The Swedish lyrics and translation can be found both further down here in the description, or in the subtitles of the video.

►  Lyrics in Swedish + English translation (Text: Astrid Lindgren)

Vargen ylar i nattens skog
(The wolf is howling in the forest of the night)
Han vill men kan inte sova
(He wants to, but cannot sleep)
Hungern river i hans varga buk
(The hunger tears his wolven stomach)
Och det är kallt i hans stova
(And it's cold in his burrow)

Du varg du varg, kom inte hit
(Wolf, wolf, don't you come here)
Ungen min får du aldrig
( I will never let you take my child)

Vargen ylar i nattens skog
(The wolf is howling in the forest of the night)
Ylar av hunger o klagar
(Howling out of hunger and moaning)
Men jag ska ge'n en grisa svans
(But I will give him a pig tail)
Sånt passar i varga magar
(Which suits a wolven stomach)

Du varg du varg, kom inte hit
(Wolf, wolf, don't you come here)
Ungen min får du aldrig
( I will never let you take my child)

...(First verse again)

On sunny days I can finally hear the birds sing again, and the sun rises higher every day.  And in the darkest of nights, the northern lights spreads its wings of light over the sky. Its a beautiful part of the winter, where we still get the cold, the snow, and the nightsky, but feeling the very first tiny signs of spring. 

I finally woke up from my little ""winter hibernation"" after feeling really uninspired for the past two weeks. I let you know a little more about that in this video. I also let you know what we been up to lately. A glimpse into our everyday life right now. 

I hope you will enjoy the video!

I want to begin by giving thanks for all the beautiful comments I got on my previous video. You have no idea how much it meant to me to receive all your love and support. THANK YOU! 

Now here comes a little video from our life right now, in the heart of winter. We continue working on building up our dreams and finding a balance in our creative mess. But we are really getting there now and very soon we will be done with our jewelry project and moving into our new working room in the old barn. That will feel like a wonderful ending on a long chapter. 

I also just started painting again, after a long time with no inspiration. In this video I let you see what I'm working on right now and how I make paint out of the ashes and charcoal from our wood stoves in the house. 
And of course, a lots of more! 

I hope you will like the video!

December 13 is a very special day here in Sweden when we celebrate the Lucia tradition. 
And for many years now, I have made it my own tradition to go out in the night to light up hundreds of candles with the intention to bring prayers of light and love our world. 
It's always a very special and magical feeling, even if this night turned into a snow storm (will show you some behind the scenes in the next video haha)

The song that I'm singing is my own version of the traditional Lucia song.
You can find the Swedish lyrics and a English translation down below (or in the subtitles).

►LUCIA SONG LYRICS - SWEDISH
Natten går tunga fjät runt gård och stuva.
Kring jord som sol'n förlät, skuggorna ruva.
Drömmar med vingesus under oss sia,
tänd dina vita ljus, Sankta Lucia.

Trollsejd och mörkermakt ljust du betvingar,
signade lågors vakt skydd åt oss bringar.
Drömmar med vingesus, under oss sia,
tänd dina vita ljus, Sankta Lucia.

Stjärnor som leda oss, vägen att finna,
bli dina klara bloss, fagra prästinna.
//Drömmar med vingesus, under oss sia,
tänd dina vita ljus, Sankta Lucia.//

► LYRICS OF THE LUCIA SONG - ENGLISH TRANSLATION
Night walks with a heavy step
Round yard and house,
As the sun departs from earth,
Shadows are brooding.
Dreams of wings rustling over us in prophesy,
Light your white candles, Saint Lucia.

Spells and dark powers, with light you subject.
Guard of the blessed flames, protection for us brings. 
Dreams of wings rustling over us in prophesy,
Light your white candles, Saint Lucia.

Stars that lead us, the way to find,
become your clear flares, fair priestess.
Dreams of wings rustling over us in prophesy,
Light your white candles, Saint Lucia.","['lucia', 'swedish', 'tradition', 'sankta lucia', 'jonna', 'jinton', 'lucia jonna jinton', 'natten går tunga fjät', 'luciasången', 'lucia song', 'lucia sång', 'saint lucia', 'sweden', 'swedish tradition', 'village', 'rural life', 'love and light', 'ancient tradition', 'nordic', 'nordic tradition', 'viking', 'modern viking', 'witch', 'mystical', 'woman', 'living in a cottage', 'mystic song', 'viking song', 'viking music', 'norse', 'nordic song', 'kulning']",2019-12-13T02:42:37Z,3975335,130481,,6176,PT3M40S,hd,true

So this video is about this last week, in the beginning of winter, with all the things going on right now. I show you how far we’ve come with the renovations in the silver smithy, and I show you some ice prints and new ice jewelry that we’ve been working on lately.

67,Qd-CwJa1SHE,Jonna Jinton,SINGING ICE - 2 HOURS RAW ICE SOUNDS | ASMR /meditation/relaxation/sleep,"Every winter as the ice begins to grow during the cold nights, it creates these otherworldly and beautiful sounds.  In this video you can hear the sounds from this year, that I recorded now in november 2019, with footage from the same ice. The sounds are made from all these beautiful cracks that you can see on the surface of the ice.

I have always thought that these sounds are so calming and relaxing to listen to. It can sometimes sound very similar to the songs of the whales in the ocean. And I also think it can remind us of how it sounded like before we entered this world. The sounds inside the womb of our mother.

I hope you will enjoy this music created by the ice, and that it will help you relax and take deep breaths. 

LISTEN WITH HEADPHONES FOR BEST QUALITY :) 

Thank you so much for watching ♥

69,chxn2szgEAg,Jonna Jinton,Did you know that ice can sing? - Ice sounds - Singing ice,"For as long as I have lived here I have been so deeply fascinated by these sounds. If you have been following me for some time you might have heard me talk about this before.
The sound of the ice is among the most beautiful and magical sounds I know, and I also believe that the sound can have a very healing effect on humans. 

The singing ice can remind us of the sounds that the whales use to communicate with each other . And just like the ice, most of the sounds are such low frequency that you can not even hear it. Only barely feel it.

It also reminds many people of the sounds that can be heard from inside womb. Maybe thats why it has such a calming effect on many people? 

So, my recordings is only giving you a little part of the magical feeling you get from the singing ice. The sounds in my video can't represent the whole feeling of being out on the ice and hear and FEEL the sounds. But at least I hope to give you a little glimpse of these musical concerts by the ice. 

Let me now if you like it or not! :)

70,iHkETG7w4Es,Jonna Jinton,Opening up and letting go | Ep. 32,"I never thought I was going to share these problems with all of you, since I thought it was over and that talking about it only would make it worse. 
But in September it happened again, and this time it was worse than ever. We had some hard days when we had to leave our house for a sick/crazy man that have been stalking me/obsessing about me in short periods of time for the last 6 years. 

When I felt the most hopeless I shared about this on my blog for the first time, telling about the nightmare we were in, and I got so incredible much support. In the end I realized that sharing this made it easier. Both because people that live close by and in towns nearby got to know about this and we could feel so much more safe knowing that people were keeping their eyes open. 

And I also realized that things like these are important to share and talk about. There are so many people going through similar things. And as I was in the middle of this ""nightmare"" I thought about all the people that goes through this every day. People that has a stalker that takes away all their freedom. That makes them live in constant fear. I just can't even imagine how that would be. 

I have just got a glimpse of it, as this man goes into ""psychosis"" once or twice every year and only stalks me during these times. But omg, that is enough. Enough for turning my life upside down. 
Enough for forcing us to leave our house in fear of what he could do. 

I just wish with all my heart that this man now gets the help he needs to keep the psychosis under control, and that we can continue living our lives just as normal. I never, ever want to spend one second feeling fear/anxiety because of this. 

So...this is the reason it took me so long to make a new vlog. We couldn't work for about 2 weeks and after that we just had so incredible much to do to catch up again.

But, now I am back again, stronger than ever! :)

71,UqU19dR0bFE,Jonna Jinton,The Art of Balancing Stones,"The very first time I tried balancing stones was back in 2010. I saw some stone sculptures in a park, when an old, wise man told me that it was a symbol for the balance of nature. I liked that idea, and after that I started making easy stone sculptures. After a while, I started experimenting with balance and I tried to make stone sculptures that had such small balance points so that it almost would look impossible.
I really loved that. 
Both because it felt like a challenge, but also because it forced me to get really still and quiet, and focus on one thing only; to find the tiny, tiny balance point. 
It more and more turned into some kind of meditation. 

I hope this video will inspire you to try it out yourself! :)

For so long I've been waiting for an opportunity to go to the mountains again. My heart has been longing like crazy. Especially every autumn I get this urge to come to this beautiful wild place. It feels like my second home. 
And finally, I went for a week to the mountains.  

I have been hiking around in the open spaces. Taken really deep breaths of the clean air. 
Swimming in the ice cold rivers in the evenings and been out all days to film and take photos. 
It's been a real boost of inspiration and energy.  

In this vlog I share some moment of this week with you. Both the ups and the downs. 
Hope you will enjoy it ♥

THANK YOU FOR WATCHING! ♥ 
Sending you all lots of love and light!

73,Pwsqto7yeYU,Jonna Jinton,Back to the earth & the creativity | Ep. 30,"My sweet friends, I am so happy to be back with a new video letting you know what I've been up to lately. I have finally entering my creative bubble. How I've missed loosing myself in creativity and in my inner world. To finally have more time again, and be more by myself (as an introvert summers can be very hard with all the social stuff haha). 

Summer is almost reaching the end and I feel such relief as the autumn is coming closer.
Every year it's the same. Summer is lovely, but woah...the end of the summer/beginning of autumn is always making me feel in love. 
It's just...something very good in the air. Do you feel the same where you live? 

Enough talking :D In this video I let you into my little world as it is right now. I hope you enjoy it!

75,9X8VVoOYrBU,Jonna Jinton,SONG OF SUMMER SOLSTICE | Kulning & Nyckelharpa,"Here is a little song that came to me during the night of summer solstice. A little kulning (ancient swedish herdingcall) together with my very first try on the beautiful ancient instrument Nyckelharpa, that i just got. 
I am totally new to it, so the tones might be a little bit shaky and shy, but I so much look forward to learn to play it so that I can use it more for my music. I think that the combination of kulning and nyckelharpa is such a perfect match. 
Sounds from the past. 

This month might be the most magical time of the year, with the dancing mist and the midnight sun. It's something very special in the air, so this is a little tribute to June and the summer solstice. I hope enjoy it! ♥

Thank you so much for watching and listening!

So it has been another crazy week here and this vlog is covering many days from last week. From itchy mosquito nights to the worst cow herding ever, and  a little stress about our upcoming wedding (in a month!!) and fixing with my new painting cottage/studio. And much more of course! 

Life is a bit intense right now with so much going on, but it will all be all right. I'm sure we will soon be able to catch up on the ""to do list"", and be able to find our new rhythm here at our lovely house. 

I just want to let you know that your wonderful comments means SO much to me. The response you give me on my videos is just...so sooo beautiful. I wish I could answer you all, but I want you to know that I try to read every single comment. THANK YOU!! ♥

I hope you like this new video! And I wish you a wonderful week everyone! ♥

It's been two really wonderful but intense weeks with the move, and in this video I will tell you all about it from the very first entry into door to now. 

After so many years of dreaming about this homestead where my ancestors lived 400 years ago, its now ours. And I can't really understand that this is not only a dream. I am so deeply thankful.

We still have a lot to do with moving to the new house but at least we now live here and in this moment I sit by the kitchen table looking out at the beautiful view over the lake. 
A new chapter has begun. And I look forward to share more from our life here.

79,VH5oxHVgUvM,Jonna Jinton,How to tap Birch Sap  | Health benefits & a taste of spring,"Tapping birch sap is one of my favorite parts of the spring. Birch sap has a very sweet taste and lots of health benefits, and it has been a part of the nordic tradition for hundreds of years.

Back in time, they said ""drinking marrow into the bones"" about drinking birch sap. It was a way of regaining energy after a long cold winter. Sometimes, they even gave it to the livestock, to give the cows, goats and horses some extra energy. 
It contains minerals and vitamins like calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese and sugar. And also proteins, amino acids and enzymes. 

In this video I show you step by step how I do when I tap birch sap. The sap can only be tapped in the early spring for about 3-4 weeks. From when the snow and the frozen ground has melted, until the first leaves starts to bloom. Depending on where you live it might differ a lot. In the south of Sweden it's around march-april, and where I live in the north of Sweden it is usually the beginning of may until the end of may. 

For many of you (if you even have birch trees where you live) it might already be to late. But I hope that you feel inspired to try it out next spring or whenever you get a chance. 

I hope you liked the video!

This year the snow started to melt a bit earlier than usual. But April is a sneaky month. It's a time when winter and spring is in a constant dance of give and take. 
This weekend it's been snowing every day again. But it is still spring in the air, and I feel so grateful for having the spring and summer ahead of us.

So here comes a little vlog from our past week. A messy week with lots of work and stuff everywhere. I really begin to feel like we are soon going to explode in here. I can't thank universe enough for making such a perfect timing with our new house in two months. 
I CAN'T WAIT!!! 

So right now our life is kinda focused on finishing the huge orderlist of jewelry that we had since august last year when we opened up our jewelry-weshop. We were not prepared that it would actually go so well! So since august we have had hundreds of orders and hundreds of wonderful customers with lots of patience, which we are thankful for. We stoped selling the jewelry since we needed to finish of all the orders first, and now after months of work, we are finally almost done. 
So in a little while we will make some new designs for a new collection later this year. And of course, make sure to be prepared this time and make some changes for the better! 

So in this vlog you get to see glimpses of our daily life right now. I hope you enjoy it!

A song to express my love and gratefulness for the winter that gave me all this magical moments during these 6 months. But also, a song to let it go. 
To let go of the cold and the dark, and welcome a new time of light and warmth.

This song is for the winter, and for all of you out there ♥
Let the ancient tones go right through your soul and carry away all the heaviness in your heart. All the worry. All the things that hold you back.
Let it melt down, back to the earth, just like the snow in the spring. 
Let it become water to nurture your new beginning.

Instrumental/Nyckelharpa (The oldest instrument in Sweden)
by my friend and producer: Mattis
Vocals/kulning by me. 


► WHAT IS KULNING?
The singing technique called ""kulning"" is an ancient Nordic herdingcall, that was used by women long time ago to call home the cattle (the cows and the goats) back home to the farm in the evenings. It was also used as a form of communication, since the high pitch sounds can be heard through very far distances.

87,JV86q4YmTFk,Jonna Jinton,A new chapter - Buying our dream house | Ep. 19,"My sweet friends, i'ts been a while. I just been going through some really challenging weeks, but in this video I can finally let you know all about what we have been going trough. And of course, sharing two really happy news with you.

It feels like a new life is starting. A new era. A revenge, for all that time that was taken away from us these years of waiting. 
In this really long vlog I share our struggle with the wind turbine industry, our dream that almost got lost. And I tell you about when I took a photo in MY SLEEP and having a strange, beautiful spiritual experience. And of course, letting you know about where we will move in the near future.

And the most important part of all, I give thanks to all of you people out there that have been helping us in the fight with the politicians and the wind turbine industry-plans. We are so many that are forever grateful for your support in this. It means more than I ever can describe. I hope you get to visit Sollefteå County, to have a walk in the beautiful forest that you've helped us fighting for. 🌷

It will soon be better!
So this last week has been the hardest week in a long time, but also the best week. No matter how much things has gone wrong we decided to just keep going and not let any shit stop us :) 

I am so deeply grateful for all you wonderful people out there that follows our journey and give us so much love, support and inspiration! ♥ Just as we say in the video, it means so much to us. 

I can't wait till I will have some more time again for all the creative projects that I want to do, and for making more videos. 
Meanwhile I try to do my best to keep making one vlog a week to let you see whats going on in our life right now. 

I hope you like the video! And thank you so much for watching!

I had a really heavy time for a while, that's why it took some time to make this video. It's been a roller coaster of feelings, long nights of work, a broken rib bone, crazy superpowers, nighttime icebaths and a lot of traveling and the most important thing of all, a breaking point. Huge changes in our future plans. I will tell you all about whats going on the last weeks in this video.

And from the bottom of my heart, I want to THANK YOU for the wonderful response and engagement on my last video, which you can see here:

But I needed to open my heart and tell you all about why I feel so depressed right now.  To let you know about the situation we are in, and that we might need to lose what we love so much. 
Even if we take one day at a time right now and try to see bright on the future, it is constantly draining us.
And of course, when one bad thing happens, much more comes at the same time...
Like, loosing the forest you loved. 

But, I feel so relieved that I finally are able to upload this extra long vlog. It felt important to me to share the reality of this situation. 
And it's been some beautiful, really cold days here and of course I wanted to give you all a little glimpse of that as well. 

With all my heart, thank you SO much for watching! ♥
And I hope you all are having a lovely december.

One day in Stockholm on a stage performing live for 1 million people, and then escaping to the wilderness, spending some time among the mountains. That's how I like it! 

If you are wondering what this cottage is all about, you can see my earlier vlog where I told all about this little house that we bought up in the beautiful mountains 3 hours from where I live. 
 ➙ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps-WKoSqb-g

99,eEDmZlVCCzc,Jonna Jinton,ICE SWIM | Feeling the power from the cold,"The winter is here again, and this time I wanted to prepare myself for this 6 cold months to come. This winter I want to feel the cold as a source of power, and not the opposite. 
I thought that taking a little swim in the ice cold water is the best way to start this winter, to really get into the very core of how cold feels like. Almost like a ritual. The ice swim become a symbol for not letting the cold take control of me.

And it's a way of testing myself. It's a strange feeling to do something when my whole body tells me to not do it. 

This is something I will try to do regularly during this winter. Because taking a ice swim really has the most amazing effect on our body and mind. I have never, ever felt so full of live as the two times I have taken a swim in ice cold water. It's like giving your body a power start. 

❄ THANK YOU Wim Hof for inspiring me to see the cold from another perspective ➙  https://www.youtube.com/user/wimhof1
Check him out for lots of inspiration! ♥

Have you ever taken a icebath/ice swim? Or is it something you would like to try one day? Or would you never even consider doing it? :) 
Please let me know in the comments!

I hope you liked the video. I hope it will bring some inspiration. Not only to take ice swims, but to face the things that drains you, and take a step outside the comfort zone. 

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING! ♥

100,1PW4zYCLYRs,Jonna Jinton,What happened with the $10 000 painting? | Ep. 8,"This new, very long vlog from our last days contain a little bit of everything. A little tour on our second floor, a sneak peak into my wardrobe, a coffee break at my grand uncle Tage (that swears alot as you can see haha) and lots of night work. I also talk a little bit about the eBay auction I had a few weeks ago, where the painting ended up in the price of $10 300. Did the auction succeed? 
I'll let you know in the vlog!

I hope you enjoy the video! And don't forget to subscribe to my channel!

101,Ps-WKoSqb-g,Jonna Jinton,We bought a Cottage | Ep. 7,"Thank you everyone for ""holding your thumbs"" as I said in my last vlog, which of course is the Swedish way of saying ""Cross your fingers"". I am so incredible happy to finally share with you that me and Johan bought our first little house together. 
It's a cottage located in the heart of the northern Swedish wilderness. 
Surrounded by endless forests, high mountains and dancing rivers and quiet lakes. 

I know, its a simple little cottage, but for us this means the world. Now we will have a little home in a place we love so much, that we can go to whenever we feel like.  

What do you guys think of the house/cottage? :) 
I will of course show you much more when we finally get the keys in about 3 weeks.

But as you can see in the vlog, there is some exciting things that might happen and I just have had a hard time to focus. In the next vlog I will definitely tell you all about whats going on! 

Oh, and btw, I accidentally deleted the WHOLE vlog when it was finished. So I had to spend some more hours making a new one haha. Ya, this week is a bit crazy. But things are good and finally I get to share some more glimpses from our last days. 
Preparing for winter, a spontaneous roadtrip to the mountains and a normal Tuesday evening. 

Ps. Hold your thumbs = Cross your fingers (in Swedish).
I was thinking that maybe other countries don't really use that. So I just wanted to explain what I meant :* 

I hope you like it!

104,ewoQpAWx9jE,Jonna Jinton,THE SOUND OF SWEDEN,"Earlier this year, I was challenged by Google Arts & Culture to make a video where I capture the sounds of the Swedish heritage.
Other YouTube creators in different countries of Europe was challenged to do the same thing.
 Then, all our sounds would be mixed together into a song that would represent the sound of the European heritage.

YOU CAN FIND THE FINAL VIDEO ""THE SOUND OF US"" AT THE END SCREEN OR HERE:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6TyALaI_s0

I felt so much for this project and really wanted to put my heart and soul into this, since I’ve always felt a special love for the cultural heritage. I really wanted to capture soul of the Swedish heritage and try to put a piece of it in my video.

The sounds that I felt represented a part of the Swedish heritage, was the sound of the forest, the sound of the oldest Swedish instrument (Nyckelharpa, played by Niklas Roswall) and of course, kulning, the ancient Swedish herdingcall. 

I have SO much looked forward to finally launch this video, together with the final video of Google Arts & Culture.

Let me know if you liked it with a thumbs up or a little comment!

109,iCK7FpHEEp4,Jonna Jinton,"THE MAKING OF PAINTING ""GOLDEN WINDS""","This is a little video showing the making of my latest painting ""Golden Winds"" that I worked on in august and september, while it still was warm enough to paint out in the barn. I would do anything if I could have my studio out there all year around. 
The smell of the old wood...the sound of the wind and just the cozy atmosphere...it inspired me so much!

""Golden Winds"" is now up for auction on Ebay, with a starting price of $1, lasting until Oct 5. Here is the link: https://www.ebay.com/itm/123394666565

I am so excited to try out this new way of selling my artworks. I hope its a way for everyone thats interested in my art to be able to join in when I have a new painting for sell. Lately people want me to email them when I have a new painting for sell...and its so hard to know who I should email first, so this feels like a more ""fair"" way. 
 And the best part, I don't need to put a price on the painting myself, which is something I've always had a hard time with. 

If you are interested, you find the link to the painting in the text above.

111,kon-h5Z5mdY,Jonna Jinton,A farewell song for my cow - Ancient Swedish Herdingcall,"So, another summer have passed. The green fields are turning yellow, and it's time for my cow Stjärna to go back to the farm during the winter. The farm is located in a village 15 km from here, so I will of course come and visit her. 

Every evening this summer I sang songs for her and brought some treats. She is so friendly and adorable.
This was the last night with Stjärna, before she went back. I called for her and as always she came running. Then I sat there singing for her and watched her until the sun went down. 
I will miss her, so very much. 

This is my farewell song for Stjärna. I also played a little ""nyckelharpa"" (the oldest swedish instrument) at the end of the song. An instrument that I try to learn right now. 

I hope you like it! Lots of love to all of you ♥️

112,1HMshnQOQTQ,Jonna Jinton,A song for the earth - Ancient Swedish herdingcall,"I've got my voice back. I can sing again. And it feels as if I got a part of my soul back. For over a half year I have not been able to sing with the same power as before. So during the summer, I did no songs and no kulning (herdingcall).
It's been a sorrow. As if I lost something very dear to me. Something I use to express myself and something I need to be able to create music that I wish will bring some peace to people. 
And I couldn't understand why. The more I tried, the worse it became. 
I was just about to accept the fact that I might never get my voice back as it once was. 
At the very same week as I let go of all the heavy feelings and pressure regarding my music and the job with my album, my voice came back. 
Stronger than ever.
The heavy feeling in my throat was gone.
Once again, life teached me an important lesson. 
That we can never, ever create anything truly beautiful with a heart heavy of pressure and with our own high expectations on ourselves. A stressful mind is not a highway to accomplish something faster. We just block the way for the energy and inspiration to flow free.
Learning to let go is a lifetime lesson I guess. But I have seen how life can just switch in the same moment as we let go of fear of not doing and being enough.
All we ever wanted to be, we already are.

113,-wFsYY71wyk,Jonna Jinton,The story of my life - From a dream to reality,"This video is about how I changed my life 8 years ago, when I left the citylife and moved 1000 km to the north and started a new life close to nature. Close to all the things my heart was longing for.

These 8 years have been so challenging and hard but also wonderful and magical in every single way.  I have learnt so much from that day I came to the old house in this smal village in the forest with no money, no job and no plan on what I should do with my life. 
But from that day I started living, for real. I started appreciating things that I had never even thought of when living in an apartment in the city. And I learnt that you can never feel the wonderful, comfort feeling of warmth if you have not yet been cold. 

I started with nothing but a dream. And today, I live my dream. Everyday I feel so thankful for still being able to live here in my little paradise deep in the forests in the north of Sweden, and working with all the things I love, and sharing my life with someone I love. 

In this video you get to see a short summary of these years. Of course, many details are not included since the video would be 2 years long if I would include all the things that happened along the way. But at least it tells my story in a big picture :) 

I hope you like it! ♥

114,VNBVywLvu7k,Jonna Jinton,Kulning - Calling home my cow Stjärna,"During the summer the young cows (heifers) comes to my village to spend some months eating fresh grass from the fields by the lake. As some of you know, I actually bought one of these cows last year.
From the first time I saw her I just fell in love with her fluffy ears and kind eyes, and every time I did some kulning she was the first one to come. 
Maybe you remember that from one of my earlier kulning videos : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc7F_qv3eI8

She spent the winter on the farm, and now she is back here again to enjoy another summer outside. 
Almost every evening I go down to the field and call for her. I named her Stjärna, which means star in Swedish. But of course, all the other ladies comes aswell, even though they are not yet sure what to think of me haha. But we have a whole summer to get to know each other.

So this video shows some very natural kulning with both short melodies and calling (lockrop) which is how it could have sound like on the farms for hundreds of years ago.

I hope you like it! Lots of love to you all!

115,ZBlppCk7Dx8,Jonna Jinton,The Secret Art of Mosquito Meditation,"You just gotta do the best of what you got, right? :)

Well, we have a lot of mosquitos here.  So much that it is impossible to sit outside in the summer evenings. After just five minutes you will be surrounded by hundreds of mosquitos. 
It's not like this everywhere in Sweden. Mostly just the northern parts.

It's a hell. But life just gets so much easier if you can see the bright side of life, right? ;)
So lets just take a deep breath and enjoy the pleasant mosquito meditation. The best mindfulness practice there is ;)

The clear sky, the fresh air, the clean water. The green fields and the mountains in the north.
I am so deeply thankful for having all this beauty all around me. 
And for having the fortune to grow up in a place where I feel free.

This is my own little version of the Swedish anthem, since today it's the Swedish national day, 6:th of june. 
I hope you like it! Lots of love and light to you all! ♥

His music have given me so many joyful moments and beautiful memories. 
I was in my studio very late on Saturday, and I just felt to do this little cover on ""Lonely together"" as a tribute to him. 

Rest in peace Tim ♥

I didn't have so much to say, as you can notice (don't you think we talk to much nowdays anyway) but I thought that sometimes words is not needed. 
I decided to put up the camera and record as much as possible, no matter what. I wanted to give you all a little closer look into my everyday life.
To invite you into my home, and share moments of happiness, tiredness, mindfulness, weirdness and all of these little special moments that a week as a human being on this earth can bring :)

In my life, no day is similar to the other, but at least you get a little glimpse of how it can look like. And if you wonder where Johan is during most of this week, he was working in another city :)
I hope you like the video! Lots of love to you all!

119,KPKuozIY7e4,Jonna Jinton,KULNING - Ancient Herdingcall - Awakening the spirit,"I just had the toughest winter of my life, with many challenges. My soul felt tired and empty, and I struggled to get back on my feet again. But all this time I had this song in my head. I knew that it would come a day when I wake up again. My mind just needed the silence, and my spirit needed to sleep. We all need that. We are all part of the cycles of nature.

Know that you too also need to rest to let new dreams and new life grow under your bark. And then, one day soon you will be ready to bloom again. Stronger than ever before. 
Just like the trees. Just like the flowers. 

This little kulning song is a symbol for awakening the spirit inside. 
To find the light in the dark. The warmth in the cold.
And wake up the soul from it's deep wintersleep. 

Lots of love and light to you all!

122,-SXF3tibKI0,Jonna Jinton,STORY: January - A NEW BEGINNING,"I'm finally back again with a new videoblogg! It's been a long time. 
To keep it short, the last months of 2017 was really challenging. Only two days after my last vlog in october I got a thrombosis in the brain (like a tiny stroke) and lost part of my eyesight. It was a very scary experience. I was really lucky that I got no permanent damages so I am all back to normal now, but it was two really though months and it took some weeks before my vision was back to normal again.

January came with this beautiful, new energy and brought some new possibilities. About two weeks ago I got to rent a house to use as my studio now when I will work with my kulning CD this year. The house is in the most beautiful location in the closest village to where I live. Here I will find the peace I need to be able to create some magic music :) So for a year or so this place will be my new working place. You can see more about this in the video! 

As some of you might now I started with Patreon in October. Even though it's only been three months it has literally changed my life and creative work. Thanks to all of my subscribers who support my work I was able to rent this house as a studio and put other jobs aside so that I can spend time working with my kulning CD. My biggest dream is to release this CD this year, and I am thankful beyond words for all the support and this wonderful opportunity! THANK YOU!!! ♥

Since many years back I have always gone out in the middle of the Lucia night to light up hundreds of candles in the forest, with the intention to spread light into the world. Maybe you have seen my earlier lucia-films here on my YouTube. 
But this year was special. Just as the other lucia-nights I prepared to get out and light up my candles. But this night, the forest surprised me :) 

This film is for all the world. For all of you wonderful people out there ♥ I hope to be able to spread some light into your hearts. 
Thank you for taking the time to watch it.

Sending you lots of love and light ♥

And it definitely happen to be one of these days when everything just felt like a mess. A felt stressed about work and  things just seemed to not go my way. I took a timeout to visit my cow at the farm, which was the most beautiful moment of this week. 

This videoblog really shows just how a normal, everyday life can look like, combining work with a life on the countryside, with cute animals and up and down moments. I hope you enjoy it!

127,nc7F_qv3eI8,Jonna Jinton,Kulning - Ancient herdingcall - A farewell song to the cows,"The singing technique called ""kulning"" is an ancient Swedish herdingcall, that was used by women long time ago to call home the cattle (the cows and the goats) back home to the farm in the evenings. It was also used as a form of communication, since the high pitch sounds can be heard through very far distances.

I sang for the cows one last time before they had to go back to the farm for the winter. I always feel a sorrow when they leave the village in the autumn. Since May they have been here on the fields, bringing some life to our little quiet village with only 10 inhabitants in the middle of the northern woods.

The sounds of cowbells in the quiet evening is one of the best sounds I know. And I love the feelings of seeing them running towards me as i sing. Especially when I see my favorite cow, Stjärna (star). She is always the first one coming.

I already miss them so much.

We had a little class in bellydance! A women named Maria, who has a summerhouse here, had taken some classes in bellydance, and now she got the brilliant idéa to do a class with some of the women who lives in this village. 

It was SO much fun. Most of us had never, ever done a bellydance class, so it was totally new to us. But we didn't care, and we danced like nobody watched us :) Just pure happiness! 

Hope you like my little video from this day.

132,DMukvymIM8A,Jonna Jinton,Ancient herding call in the northern night,"Kulning - the ancient Swedish herding call in the middle of the forest in the bright nordic night. There is something truly magical about singing in a place like this, surrounded by the trees and the dancing mist. And in the night, the echoes is so loud it sometimes feels like someone is answering me. 

I know a lot of you are asking how it's going with my album with kulning. It took longer time than I first thought, but I will put my whole soul and heart to make it just as I want, and that takes time. I also have the honor to work with a really great musician called Mats Pettersson, which plays the mandola in the end of this video. I am so thankful to be able to work with someone who knows exactly what feeling I want to bring into this album. 
I will work really hard with this during the autumn and winter, and sometime in 2018 it will be released. It is my biggest dream to do this album, so I really look forward that. 

Thank you everyone for your wonderful love and support! It inspires me so much.

133,9cZ6mujPbaE,Jonna Jinton,Observing the dance of light - Summer solstice meditation,"I did this little film now on one of these bright nights of june, just before summer solstice, as the mist were dancing over the meadows. Just some very long and slow scenes of silence, as I want this film to give you the feeling of just observing the magic of summer solstice. Observing how the mist is moving.  I hope it will inspire you to relax together with me in this moment. 

Nights like these...are true happiness to me. Just being out there in nature and experience all these magical moments. And then to share it with you. It makes it all even more joyful.

I wish you all a beautiful summer solstice.

134,XndtPdYmq40,Jonna Jinton,Kulning - Ancient Swedish Herdingcall of the Forest,"Yesterday I went out in the forest to do some kulning, the ancient northern herding call. Kulning were used in Sweden a long time ago to call the cattle and as a communication. Because of it's very high pitch tones the sound can travel through very far distances and create magical echoes. 

If you like my kulning it would mean SO much to me if you would like to subscribe to my channel. I will keep you updated with new videos of my ancient calling.

135,7qv-0rA-nWI,Jonna Jinton,Calling the geese with kulning - ancient swedish herdingcall,"This evening I went out in the forest to enjoy the spring and the singing birds. I got inspired to sing myself and after a while, as the snow began to fall, the geese or cranes on the other side of the forest answered me. This happened a few years ago also. It is just such a magical feeling to communicate with the geese. I have no idea if they really did answer me, but I love to think that we did have some kind of connection. We shared a moment while enjoying the wonderful spring.

136,XrKFEd-QBi8,Jonna Jinton,Kulning - Traditional ancient Swedish singing,"Just me doing a little ""kulning"", that I recorded two weeks ago. A bit more power in this kulning. I added some scenes that I recorded when I was in Saltoluokta (Northern Sweden) last month.  Kulning can really have so many different styles, and that's what I love about it. 
High pitch, or much lower. Very strong or very soft. I love to mix these styles, to find my very own voice. 

I am still working on my kulning- CD, and really hope to release it this year. Thank you everyone for your love and support. I don't know how many times your beautiful comments about my kulning have made tears in my eyes. You really bring me that energy that I sometimes need to get going with this project. Thank you, from my heart.

In Saltoluokta there is a mountain center where people can stay. So I booked 4 nights here. And there is no roads to this place, so I had to walk 4 km over the ice. It is really an amazing place, and I can't wait to show you more of my wonderful days here.

I've heard that if you stay in the water for about 30 seconds you will not feel the cold and the body will get a rush of endorphins. So this cold saturday me, Johan and my best friends went down to the lake to make a hole in the ice. 

I had decided to really push myself to the limits and stay in there until I felt that warm feeling. And so I did! And truly it was a wonderful and refreshing feeling. Afterwards I had more energy than ever before, and I felt sooo happy :) 

Hope you enjoyed to watch! :)

To ""solve"" the problems they give education to parents how to give birth in a car (its not a joke!). After only 3 weeks the first young women had to give birth in her car. We are a lot of people here in the middle north of Sweden that think this is terrible! So here we sing the ""BB blues"" which is for the nursery hospital in Sollefteå Sweden. Sollefteå BB.

148,6fglBL7eQIA,Jonna Jinton,Kulning - a northern herdingcall in the forest,"Today in the forest I recorded some spontaneous ""kulning"", the ancient northern herdingcall. One of the things I love about kulning is the very special ""in between"" sounds. Not sad, not happy. Just something in between. Something very emotional that calls to our soul. Fragile, and very strong at the same time. 

Sorry about the bad sound in the high pitch parts. It is hard to know how far away to stand from the camera because of the very high sound. I will be better with that :)

156,eANW9s-UTuM,Jonna Jinton,My days in Yosemite National Park,"In September I got to on the journey of my dreams. I visited the Yosemite national park together with my fiance Johan. For 8 days we explored the park and experienced the most breathtaking moments. 
This is a loooong videoblog made from all the videos I filmed with my smaller camera during this trip. A mix of all emotions. A lot of happiness though :)

165,7HZMY8mJcZ0,Jonna Jinton,Weird moments behind a photography trip,"This week I was away to do one of my most important photography jobs ever. A campaign photography for Hyundai. Since I had two cars this time I got help from my mum. And I had just 3 days to take the photos since I now leave for another job in USA, so it was so little time to make everything perfect. I wanted to take the photos in the northern mountains, but everything seemed to go wrong. We drove over 1000 km during theses days. But everything ended up fine and I got the photos I wanted! It just was a lot of work before we found the right place in the right time. I wished I had filmed more but these little moments is everything that I had time to film ;) Enjoy my weird, fragile artist soul.

169,u0e9A_hV1RU,Jonna Jinton,"Using swedish herding call ""kulning"" to call home escaping cows","Yesterday (3 july) the cows in our village escaped out of their fence, and were on the way of of the village to the woods. For the first time in my life I really got use for the ""kulning"", the ancient swedish herding call that were used long time ago to call in the cows. It really did work! They turned around to listen, and then they came running the right way towards me. With help from my mom we managed to get them into another cow pen. I can't describe what a wonderful feeling it was to see the cows following my song. Kulning really works and I will continue to learn this ancient voice techique. Especially now when I could help my neighbour to stop the cows from running into the woods.

185,Ioum5Xr-nS0,Jonna Jinton,Kulning - Call of victory,"Back in the northern woods again after winning the ""Inspirer of the year"" award in Stockholm. Of course I had to celebrate and tell my beloved forest that i'm back again, with a price! 

""Kulning is the word for the ancient Swedish herding call, that has its roots in the nordic medieval age. Because of its special high-pitched sound it was used to communicate with animals and creature through very far distances. Ever since I was a child i have felt something magical and enchanting about this sound. It really touches me in a way I can't explain. So the last months I have practiced this vocal technique to learn it myself. So this is a short example of me doing ""kulning"" :)""
